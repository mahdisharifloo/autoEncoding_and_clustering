#### how can we make better algothms for similarity
- detecting where images foucused                       ----->  0%
- removing the background                               ----->  90%
- detecting the base color of foucused component        ----->  0%
- selecting and finding important aria in images        ----->  0%
     such as یقه,آستین,دکمه,زیپ , ...  
- selecting and finding segments of body.               ----->  0%
- using unsupervise learning for clustering images.     ----->  80%
- making sub-models that work on little segment of image----->  0%
- making desition tree with sub-models outputs.         ----->  0%
- combining several algorithms together                 ----->  30%
    - designing algorithms
    - developing and make result or give some output
    - getting algorithms results together 
    - dimetion reducing
